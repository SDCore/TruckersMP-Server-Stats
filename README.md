# TruckersMP Server Stats Discord Bot

This discord bot allows users to view stats about TruckersMP Servers, such as current player count, amount of people in queue, and other similar information. The information is provided by the [TruckersMP API](https://stats.truckersmp.com/api).

It's currently in a big stage of a rewrite, but it's slowly getting there.
